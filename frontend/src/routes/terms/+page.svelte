        <p class="mt-2">
          These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access to and use of SubSlush's website,
          any apps, and related services (collectively, the "Platform"), and your purchase of
          Products from SubSlush.

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">2. Key concept: SubSlush is not an open marketplace</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          SubSlush sells Products directly to Customers. We may source Products or services through
          lawful wholesale suppliers or service partners, but:
        </p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>you do not buy from individual marketplace sellers; and</li>
          <li>the contract for your purchase is between you and SubSlush.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">4. Electronic contracting</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          You agree that these Terms, Order confirmations, and related notices may be provided
          electronically, and that contracts can be formed electronically through the Platform.
          Hong Kong recognizes contracts formed by electronic records under the Electronic
          Transactions Ordinance.

        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">6. Products, fulfillment, and delivery</h2>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">6.1 Subscription Products</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">Subscription Products may be fulfilled by (depending on the Product page or checkout details):</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>upgrading access on a Third-Party Service account you designate;</li>
          <li>inviting you to a plan or entitlement;</li>
          <li>providing redemption instructions and/or codes; or</li>
          <li>other methods described at checkout.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Fulfillment methods can vary by Product, plan term, or provider. We may disclose the
          method on the Product page or at checkout, or confirm it with you after purchase and
          before delivery to ensure you approve the method used.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">6.2 Keys and license codes</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          For license keys, delivery typically occurs by displaying the key in your account, sending
          it by email, or otherwise making it available digitally.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">6.3 Delivery timeframe</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          We aim to deliver within 24 hours, but delivery can take up to 72 hours due to verification
          steps, provider constraints, availability, or technical factors.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">6.4 Your cooperation</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Some Products require your action (for example, accepting an invite or confirming account
          details). Delays caused by missing details or delayed Customer actions are not our
          responsibility.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">7. Pricing, taxes, and payment</h2>

        <p class="mt-2">Taxes may be included or added depending on your location and legal requirements.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Payments are processed by third-party payment providers. We receive payment status and
          transaction references, but typically do not store full card details.

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">9. Third-Party Services: outages, changes, enforcement</h2>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">9.1 Provider outages or disruptions</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          SubSlush is not responsible for downtime, outages, latency, or functionality changes
          caused by Third-Party Services. SubSlush provides the premium subscription entitlement
          or upgrade; the Third-Party Service provides the actual service operation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-sm font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">9.2 Provider enforcement actions</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">
          If a Third-Party Service restricts, limits, or disables an account due to your conduct
          (including illegal use or violating provider policies), SubSlush may deny warranty
          remedies after investigation. If we determine the issue was caused by SubSlush's
          fulfillment, we will provide a remedy under our

        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>use the Platform or Products for fraud or unlawful activity;</li>
          <li>attempt to bypass security, scrape, reverse-engineer, or disrupt the Platform;</li>
          <li>use stolen or unauthorized payment methods;</li>
          <li>resell Products where prohibited by law or by the Product page terms.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-2">We may suspend or terminate accounts or refuse Orders if prohibited use is detected.</p>

        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">11. Cancellations and refunds (summary)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">Your rights are set out in the Refund and Warranty Policy. In summary:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Before delivery: you may request cancellation. If not delivered yet, we will cancel and refund minus non-recoverable third-party processing fees.</li>
          <li>After delivery: due to the digital nature of Products, no returns or refunds are available (subject to mandatory law).</li>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">12. Chargebacks and disputes</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute, we may suspend service while we
          investigate. Fraudulent disputes may result in refusal of future service.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">13. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">To the fullest extent permitted by Hong Kong law:</p>
        <ul class="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>the Platform is provided "as is" and "as available"; and</li>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">14. Limitation of liability (Hong Kong)</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, SubSlush will not be liable for indirect or
          consequential losses (including loss of profits) arising from use of the Platform or
          Products.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Hong Kong's Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance restricts certain exclusions or
          limitations (for example, you generally cannot exclude liability for death or personal
          injury from negligence, and other exclusions may be subject to reasonableness).
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude liability where doing so would be unlawful.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">15. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          All Platform content (branding, text, UI, graphics) is owned by or licensed to SubSlush.
          You may not copy or reuse it except as permitted by law.

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-base font-semibold uppercase tracking-wide">16. Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">
          We may update these Terms by posting a new version on the Platform. Changes apply from

          notice.

          principles, unless mandatory consumer laws applicable to you provide otherwise.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">
          Any dispute will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Hong Kong,
